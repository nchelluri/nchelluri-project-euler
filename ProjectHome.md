"[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." - Project Euler Website

These are my naive solutions, inspiring me slowly to learn a bit of number theory.  I really just like coding and seeing that solution light go off :)
